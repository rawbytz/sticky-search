## Sticky Search for WorkFlowy
* Zoom In and Out and keep search active 
  * _Ctrl+Alt+Down_ = **Zoom In Keep Search** (Mac: control+Option+Down)
  * _Ctrl+Alt+Up_ = **Zoom Out Keep Search** (Mac: control+Option+Up)
* Navigate Siblings and keep search active 
  * _Ctrl+Alt+Left_ = **Jump to Previous Sibling, Keep Search** (Mac: control+Option+Left)
  * _Ctrl+Alt+Right_ = **Jump to Next Sibling, Keep Search** (Mac: control+Option+Right)
* With no search active, these shortcuts operate just like the built-in WorkFlowy shortcuts for Zoom and Jump to Siblings.
